# Stonegame
School project

[Live demo](http://stonegame.tondakozak.cz/)

Web game written in a pure JavaScript.

The project requirements said that the logging and user registrations must be done using HTML5 LocalStorage API.

Extract from the project requirements:
- Website that enables the user to play a game. 
- The user plays the game alone or against the computer. 
- If the user plays against the computer, there are no extra marks for sophisticated artificial intelligence: simple random choices are fine. 
- The game must be implemented in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. 
- Extra marks are available for games with more sophisticated functionality. 
- Users can create accounts and login.  
- The website has a page that displays the top scores of all registered users. 
- User data is stored in JSON format using HTML local storage. 
- Cross-browser compatibility is not required â€“ you only need to demonstrate your game on a single browser. 
- PHP is used to output navigation menus, footers, etc. 
- Marks are available for code quality and the attractiveness and usability of the website

The marks I received for that project is 100/100.
